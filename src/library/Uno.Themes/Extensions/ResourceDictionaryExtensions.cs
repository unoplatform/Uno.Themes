		// In order for the override to work, it has to be included within MaterialResource.MergedDictionary (see: @2).
		// Otherwise the brush/font will be resolved with the default font/colors. Due to the way MaterialResource is setup,
		// we don't have direct access to the nested resources, early enough (is this necessary?).
		// We workaround this by using a "delay-one" initialization hack. TL;DR: OverrideSource is merged into the next new instance ctor'd.
		// MaterialFonts/Colors contains a static field to hold the override dictionary.
		// We can indirectly assign this field through OverrideSource dependency property. And in the .ctor, we merge this dictionary if available.
		// And, the initialization sequence will look like the following:
		// 1. MaterialColors@1 is ctor'd, but the static field is still null.
		// 2. MaterialColors@1 OverrideSource is set, and we store that to the static field.
		// 3. MaterialColors@2 inside the MaterialResources is ctor'd, the static field is non-null, so we merge that.

		// That works fine, except on uwp/winui-desktop where it is illegal to nest the same instance of dictionary under multiple parent dictionary.
		// That happens when we new up any instance of MaterialFonts/Colors after the "delay-one" hack has proc'd once directly or indirectly:
		// 4. MaterialColors@3 is ctor'd, the static field IS NON-NULL, so we merge that AGAIN.

		// While we can set the static field to null after merging it, it would break if we define MaterialToolkitResources after MaterialResources.
		// The toolkit res would not receive the proper override, unless we define another MaterialColors with override.
		// But that is not intuitive for the user and would require additional explanation.
		// So to keep it simple, we will just always merge a clone instead of original instance (we have no way of determining if the dict is already a child of another).
