## Uno Themes Styles

[Uno Themes](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Themes) is the repository for add-ons NuGet packages that can be added to any new or existing Uno solution.

It contains three libraries:

- `Uno Themes`: a library that contains the base resources, extensions, and helper classes for the different design system libraries
- `Uno Material`: a library that contains styles following the [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) Design System
- `Uno Cupertino`: a library that contains styles following the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines)

Both `Material` and `Cupertino` libraries help you style your application with a few lines of code including:

- Color system for both Light and Dark themes
- Styles for existing WinUI controls like Buttons, TextBox, etc.

## Fluent Controls Styles

Uno Platform 3.0 and above supports control styles conforming to the [Fluent design system](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent).
