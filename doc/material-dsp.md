# Using the DSP Tooling in Uno.Material

## Introduction

Is it possible to automate the creation of the Material Design color palette? Yes, it is. Uno.Material provides a tooling to generate the color palette from the official Material Design color palette. This tooling is available in the [Uno.Dsp.Cli](https://nuget.org/packages/Uno.Dsp.Cli) and [Uno.Dsp.Tasks](https://nuget.org/packages/Uno.Dsp.Tasks) NuGet packages. The following instructions will cover the Uno.Dsp.Tasks version, which is more automatic.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you are referencing the generated XAML file in your
> application's `App.xaml` file, as shown in the following example:
>
> ```xml
>  <MaterialTheme xmlns="using:Uno.Material"
>                 ColorOverrideSource="ms-appx:///PROJECT_NAME/Styles/Application/MaterialColorsOverride.xaml" />
> ```
>
> More details [In the _Manual Color Overrides_ section of the Getting Started page](xref:Uno.Themes.Material.GetStarted)

## The Uno.Dsp.Tasks NuGet package

This package will be automatically present in the project after [creating a new Uno Platform project](https://aka.platform.uno/get-started) specifying the _Material_ theme. It is also possible to add it manually to an existing Uno Platform project by adding the following line to the _PackageReference_ section of the _csproj_ file:

* Add a nuget package reference:

   ```xml
   <PackageReference Include="Uno.Dsp.Tasks" Version="[latest version]" />
   ```

* The package is already present when you select _Material_ theme during project creation:

It is possible to configure the import process. The _UnoDspImportColors_ item found in the _csproj_ file has a number of attributes we can set:

| Attribute        | Description                     | Default Value           |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `Include`        | Style files to input            |                         |
| `Generator`*     | Type of generator to use        | `Xaml`                  |
| `OutputPath`**   | Path to use for the output      | Input file directory    |

\* The possible values for `Generator` are `Xaml` or `Csharp`.

\*\* If `Include` is a glob (eg: \*.json), `OutputPath` should be a directory.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
   <UnoDspImportColors Include="Styles\*.json" Generator="Csharp" OutputPath="Styles\Theme\"  />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Generating a custom color palette and exporting it as a JSON file

1. Navigate to the [Material Theme Builder](https://aka.platform.uno/uno-material-themebuilder) and select the colors you want to use for your application.
2. When you are done customizing, open the **Export** section located at the top rightmost of the screen.

3. In the **Export** section, locate the _Export_ button and pick the _Material Theme (JSON)_ format.

   ![material-theme-export-button](assets/material-theme-export-button.png) ![material-theme-export-json](assets/material-theme-export-json.png)
4. Save the file to your computer.
5. Replace the `ColorPaletteOverride.json` file in the `Styles` folder of your application project with the one you just downloaded.
6. Build your application. The `ColorPaletteOverride.xaml` file will be automatically updated with the colors present in the JSON file.

## More flexibility

Using `Uno.Dsp.Tasks` will generate the file at each build, potentially overriding any changes you made to it. If you want to keep it that way, you can remove the `ColorPaletteOverride.json` file from the `Styles` folder so it won't get overwritten.

Alternatively, you can use the [Uno.Dsp.Cli](https://nuget.org/packages/Uno.Dsp.Cli) package to generate the file from the command line. This tool allows you to generate the file only when desired rather than during every build.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Material Theme Builder Tool** doesn't export **Material Tokens (DSP)** packages anymore, to import DSP packages just follow the same steps described previously and save the downloaded DSP zip file as `ColorPaletteOverride.zip` in the `Styles` folder of your application project.
> In that case, make sure to delete the `material-theme.json` file from `Styles` folder before building your application, to avoid conflicts.
